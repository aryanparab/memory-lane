Remember the boat ride, the creak of the oars, and the taste of steaming momos devoured with numb fingers? Nainital. A swirl of vibrant colors and shared stories, etched forever in our hearts."

      "description": "Breach Day – the air crackling with anticipation, a nervous energy that tasted like static on the tongue. The airlock hissed open, a sudden, blinding rush of freedom and the scent of ozone after months of recycled air. It was more than just stepping outside; it was breathing life again, feeling the sun, however filtered, warm on our faces. I remember the clumsy scramble for position, everyone eager to be first, yet hesitant to break the unspoken line. And then, the gasp – the collective inhale of a world reborn, a world we'd fought so hard to reclaim."
